# Vehicle-Recognition-Model
### Abstract

To explore and understand the inner workings of the massive data that the world is coming into contact with. This project further explores the methodologies, strategies and tools used to decompose large amounts of data into interpable results. In this project we were tasked with developing scalable web scraping bots to collect massive amounts of vehicale data. With this data we applied methods such as data-preprocessing/ data cleaning, statistical analysis, big data visualizations, and tested with machine learning model.
