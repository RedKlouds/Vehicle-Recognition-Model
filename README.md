# Vehicle-Recognition-Model
### Abstract

With the advancment of the internet, more people are being connected all over the world through software. With all these connections, many companies are able to collect massive user data, with the hope to understanding if there are any patterns to help drive busniess. In this project we explore how to digest large random data inorder to make meaningful obersations from them. This project further explores the methodologies, strategies and tools used to decompose large amounts of data into interpable results. In this project we were tasked with developing scalable web scraping bots to collect massive amounts of vehicale data. With this data we applied methods such as data-preprocessing/ data cleaning, statistical analysis, big data visualizations, and tested with machine learning model.
